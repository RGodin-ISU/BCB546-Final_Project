This code tries to reproduce a select portion of figures from [Chen et al., 2023's](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.2c00662) *Deep Mutational Scanning of an Oxygen-Independent Fluorescent Protein CreiLOV for Comprehensive Profiling of Mutational and Epistatic Effects*. To run this code, please ensure that the raw data from the paper has been processed and saved in `data/processed` by running the code in `data_processing.RMD`.

The following libraries are needed for the data processing.

```{R}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Figure Reproduction

### Load the data

```{R}
single_mutant_data <- read.csv("data/processed/single_mutant_data.csv")
combinatorial_mutation_data <- read.csv("data/processed/combinatorial_mutant_data.csv")
```

Checking the first few lines, last few lines, and dimensions of the file to see if the data loaded correctly.

```{R}
head(single_mutant_data)
tail(single_mutant_data)
dim(single_mutant_data)

head(combinatorial_mutation_data)
tail(combinatorial_mutation_data)
dim(combinatorial_mutation_data)
```
