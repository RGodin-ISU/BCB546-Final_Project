## Overview

This project attempts to reproduce a subset of the main analyses and figures of the paper. It includes:

- Overview of the paper we are replicating our results (`Chen_et_al-2023.MD`)
- Preprocessed and raw data in (`data/`)
- Scripts used for to process the raw data, analyze the data, and plot figures (`analysis_pipeline/`)
- Replicated figures (`figures/`)
- PDF versions of the RMD processing and analysis code showing what the output should look like. (`analysis_pipeline/`)

## 📦 Requirements

This project was written in R and was run in Rstudio Version 2024.12.1+563 (2024.12.1+563). To install Rstudio, follow the instructions for your given operating system: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/


It requires several R libraries and these are described at the beginning of the `analysis_pipeline/data_processing.RMD` and `analysis_pipeline/data_analysis.RMD` scripts.


## 🚀 How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RGodin-ISU/BCB546-Final_Project.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies (see above).

3. Run the main analysis script(s):
   1. First, run `analysis_pipeline/data_processing.RMD` to process the raw data for analysis. The output processed data files are stored in `data/processed`.
   2. Second, run `analysis_pipeline/data_analysis.RMD`. The output figures are printed to the terminal but also saved to `figures/` for analysis.

## 📁 Data

- **Raw data:** See `data/raw/`. These are the original datasets as described in the paper.
- **Processed data:** See `data/processed/`. These are derived from the raw data and used in the analysis scripts for figure generation.

## 📊 Figures

The main figures replicated from the paper are saved in `figures/`. Each figure is labeled corresponding to the figure number in the paper, e.g., `fig_1b.png`.

## 📝 Notes

- While the overall results are consistent, there are slight differences, likely due to unavailable details. These are described in more detail in `Chen_et_al-2023.MD`.
