Figure 1B: In summary, this figure is depicting the pairwise relationships between replicate 1, replicate 2, and replicate 3. More specifically, the paper was interested
in examining the correlation between the fluorescence levels calculated by the simple mean between the three replicates. The first plot (rep1 vs rep2) indicates a correlation of 0.95,
meaning the data are highly positively correlated. The second plot (rep1 vs rep3) is also indicating a positive correlation given R = 0.957. 
Lastly, the third plot (rep2 vs rep3) is also indicating a positive correlation given R = 0.961, which is even greater than plots 1 and 2.
