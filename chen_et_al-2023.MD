## Paper Overview

This paper details the use of a combinatorial mutagenesis strategy to optimize the fluorescent properties of CreiLOV, a flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent protein (FbFP.) FbFPs are advantageous compared to traditional fluorescent reporters such as GFP due to the lack of requirement for oxygen to produce fluorescence, making them applicable for use in anaerobic environments. One drawback is the relatively lower fluorescence generated by the protein when compared to other fluorescent proteins, along with a lowered quantum yield, leading the researchers to devise a high-throughput strategy to identify mutations that could alleviate some of these issues. Single mutants at each residue were created and evaluated for fluorescence, with a set of 15 residues and 20 specific mutations identified for their increased fitness and mutation tolerance. From this set, a combinatorial mutagenesis strategy was employed in order to assess epistatic effects, due to multiple mutations potentially interacting and changing the fluorescence of the protein. Employment of this strategy was successful in identifying the epistatic effects of multiple mutations on CreiLOV fluorescence and allowed for identification of specific mutants that may be suitable for serving as reporters in anaerobic contexts.

## Results Summary

### Figure 1B

In summary, this figure is depicting the pairwise relationships between replicate 1, replicate 2, and replicate 3. More specifically, the paper was interested
in examining the correlation between the fluorescence levels calculated by the simple mean between the three replicates. The first plot (rep1 vs rep2) indicates a correlation of 0.95,
meaning the data are highly positively correlated. The second plot (rep1 vs rep3) is also indicating a positive correlation given R = 0.957. 
Lastly, the third plot (rep2 vs rep3) is also indicating a positive correlation given R = 0.961, which is even greater than plots 1 and 2.

# Figure 2B (lower panel)

In order to replicate the lower panel of figure 2b, first the mutation position numbers needed to be extracted from data set S1, which contains the single mutant data. A regular expression was used to extract the position number from the mutant name string, and this was saved as a new column in the data frame. As the mean fluorescence from each of the three replicates was already calculated as a column, the next step was to plot a boxplot of mean fluorescence values at each position in the protein. The position was used as a factor when plotting in order to group data for each position together, which resulted in a near-identical recreation of the original plot. 

# Figure 3A

In order to replicate figure 3a, more filtering had to be performed on both data sets. In the paper, 15 residues with 20 specific mutations were selected, and these were listed in data set S2 in rows 2-21. The specific mutation names were extracted from S2 and saved as a vector. Additionally, the 15 specific positions on the protein were manually entered into a vector to use for filtering. The mean value for the wildtype was extracted from S1 and saved as a value to be superimposed on the chart. In the paper, the graph shows the fluorescence plotted in black at each of the 15 positions, using all of the single-mutant data from S1, with the specific mutants listed in S2 plotted in red. One issue with reproducing the chart is the apparent lack of a data point for one of these specific mutations - Val107Met. Val107Met is listed in S2 as being one of the 20 selected mutations, but no single mutant value exists for Val107Met in S1. The red highlighted point at position 107, which should correspond to Val107Met is located above the mean wildtype fluoresence line (above 14,000 fluorescence units) but the data point in S2 for Val107Met is only at around 12,000 fluorescence units, indicating they did not use this point for the graph. It is unclear why this point is missing from the data set, as they do not explicitly list out the 20 specified mutants in the paper, rather the list had to be extracted from S2. From the single mutant data in S1, the 19 specified mutants (the 20 listed aside from Val107Met which doesn't exist in S1) were filtered out, so they would not be plotted twice. The selected mutants were filtered from S1 to a separate data frame to be plotted separately in red. The specific plot used wasn't specified, so a boxplot was used to graph the fluorescence at each point for the single-mutant data less the selected mutants. The bars shown in the paper are not error bars, as plotting the mean fluorescence +/- the standard deviation yields a much larger range for the bars, so it's not clear what the original authors had graphed. The mean wildtype fluorescence was plotted as a blue horizontal dashed line on top of the chart, and the selected mutant data points were plotted in red - note the lack of red point at position 107, corresponding to the lack of S1 data for Val107Met. Notably, there are data points in the recreated figure lying below the mean fluorescence line that do not exist in the original paper - it is unclear if these are outliers that the authors had removed prior to plotting, but there was no description of their data processing workflow that would indicate any specific type of data trimming. Overall, the reproduction looks very similar to the original figure, but without knowing what type of data trimming the authors did and what type of plot they used, it's difficult to get an exact carbon copy.
